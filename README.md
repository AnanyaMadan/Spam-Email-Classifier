Spam emails are a common nuisance that can clutter our
inboxes and waste our time. That's where a spam email classifier comes in. 

This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham).

#Features:

1) Leverages machine learning algorithms to identify spam emails.
2) Trains on provided datasets of spam and ham emails.
3) Classifies new emails based on the trained model.
